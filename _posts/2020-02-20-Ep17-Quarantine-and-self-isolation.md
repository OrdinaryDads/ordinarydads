A mostly planned out discussion on technology, trends, raising kids and family life through the lens of fatherhood. Hosted by Dan and Mike. The guys are joined by returning guest Leonard and new guest Ding.

This is a special chat about China, technology and banking in that country as well as the Coronavirus/Covid-19 (topic of the moment). We will be back to our regular podding in the next one.

Special Note: This is a very long podcast. I blame Ding for talking a lot :)

On the show:
1. Special guests!
2. Tech, payments and banking in China (8:40)
3. Coronavirus from the perspective of someone quarantined. I mean self-isolated. (43:17)
4. Leonard's conspiracy theories (51:58)
5. More Coronavirus experiences (55:57)
6. End (1:14:03)
