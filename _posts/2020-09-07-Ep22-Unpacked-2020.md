It's been a while since Episode 21 so hopefully this isn't too weird. Some of what we say may be a bit August centered... if that's a thing. Our video feeds also cut out a bit throughout, sorry!

Ordinary Dads is a mostly planned out discussion on technology, trends, raising kids and family life through the lens of fatherhood.

Hosted by Dan and Mike.
