A mostly planned out discussion on technology, trends, raising kids and family life through the lens of fatherhood. Hosted by Dan and Mike. This week we dive into Coronavirus chat and how it's affecting our daily lives, workplaces and holiday plans. Note that this was recorded before the latest government restrictions so it may sound a touch out of date. Just concentrate on our silken vocals, not on the content :)
