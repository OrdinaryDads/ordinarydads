## BBQ

What we cooked on the weekend
* Michael’s attempts + experience
* Dan’s cook + experience

Don’t need to go into too much depth this episode, unless it is full topic


## Smartwatch chat

**Dan’s thoughts**

* Most people don’t need one, phone is usually enough
* What do I have and what do I use it for?
	* Apple Watch Series 2
	* tracking my running due to GPS and HR monitor
	* sleep tracking
	* setting Siri reminders
	* distracting my kids
	* Using it to timebox stuff for my kids, like bedtime and pre-bedtime. “Hey Siri, set a timer for 5 mins” when I say I’m switching off the light in 5 mins
* What did I think I would use it for?
	* honestly i don’t know
	* i think i just wanted to shiny new tech
	* I had a pebble watch previously which I really liked. Sleep tracking was the key part of that then
* Why is sleep tracking important?
	* For some background, for about most of the past 5 years my kids have woken up atleast once during the night about 90% of the time.
	* Sleep tracking was both good (and bad) at showing me how little sleep I was getting, or how disrupted my sleep was. 
	* Despite the info, I really liked knowing how good or bad this was
