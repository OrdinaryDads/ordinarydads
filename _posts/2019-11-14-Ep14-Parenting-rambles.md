WE ARE BACK

After a fairly long hiatus due to Mike having a baby, school holidays, sicknesses and other stuff, we are finally back with a new podcast.

A mostly planned out discussion on technology, trends, raising kids and family life through the lens of fatherhood. Hosted by Dan and Mike. This week, we try something a bit different and focus almost entirely on parenting and family chat.

On the show:
1. Mike now has 3 kids under the age of 3!
2. Anniversary trips not going to plan
3. Gold Coast family roadtrip report
4. Managing weddings with 3 young kids
5. Flashback to Dan's marriage proposal
6. Regrets about not non-existent video of us as kids (and how its different now)
