Welcome to the Ordinary Dads podcast.

This is our first Episode

"What's Ordinary Dad's?"

I like to think of it as a A mostly planned out discussion on technology, trends, raising kids and family life through the lens of fatherhood. Not just perfect fatherhood.  So like, ordinary dads like you and me.

So who are we?

I'm Dan. Father of two very active boys: a 5 year old and an almost 2 year old. I'm keen on barbequeing and smoking meats American style, a big football (soccer) fan and a fading gamer. That is, I used to be a big gamer, but I've faded off and tend to only play digital card games like Hearthstone and Magic the Gathering on my PC. That's the sort of level of nerd i am.

My co-host here is Michael: "Hi...."

<Michael Intro>

So that's us! Let's get into the podcast

## Phones?

Phone discussion

Because phone and mobile devices are a big topic for a lot of people and it sort of defines us as people.  Let's chat a bit about our device history so you can get a sense of where we are coming from.

I've been messing around with smartphones since the mid 2000s... and this will show how much of a nerd i am... I had a Sony Ericsson P900, a hybrid palm pilot style phone thing with a keyboard. Fast forward to when proper smartphones came out, I had a Blackberry Bold around the time that the first iPhone came out. Keyboards for me were a thing.

When the iphone 4 came out I went for it as it looked awesome... but after a couple of years I was getting bored of iOS and was excited to switch to a Samsung Galaxy S3. After a bad experience losing all of my photos and videos on my phone from a trip to Switzerland due to the phone dying, I changed to a HTC One, then Sony Xperia Z2....

I came back to iPhone with the iPhone 6, mainly because I had my first son and my wife was always annoyed at how slow it was for my Android phones to open up the camera...

I thought I'd be stuck on iOS for a while, as I upgraded to iPhone 7, got an Apple Watch and also had a few iPads in that time.

Recently, my brother switched away from iOS to the Pixel 3. And after seeing pics that he took on the phone, we were like: dang that's some good photos. So since Vodafone had a good deal on the smaller Pixel 3 we decided to go for it.

Michael, how about you?
